- i want to show different options with an integration to stripe
- stripe is the money/payment collector
- and I want to test this and see what is the winning combination
- all of it must be profitable, so based on costs of hosting, db, redis, whatever, the unit cost must make up for it for about  a certain number X, so when X have paid, we'd have made the money for the money, any more and is profit



- we want to also get people spending the vybes
- because that depletes it so that they can buy more
- want to have promotions going to give vybes, because doesn't cost us any money but makes more engagment
- we want to have a system where people spend vybes motivate them to do this
- want to be able to test with different combinations
- spend select from [R, S, T] based on the feature or A/B test category
- find what works, how do we wish to categorize this
